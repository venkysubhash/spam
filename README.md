Spam Message/Email Detector
Overview
This is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to detect whether an email or message is classified as spam or legitimate (ham). Using a pre-trained machine learning model, the app analyzes the input text and returns its classification instantly.

Features
User-friendly Interface: Simple and clean UI built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

Text Input Area: Users can type or paste emails/messages to be checked.

Spam Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained model and vectorizer loaded from pickle files to predict the spam status.

Interactive Elements: Includes date and time inputs, sidebar options to select message type, balloons for celebration, and a checkbox for user feedback.

Visuals: Displays an image/logo to enhance the applicationâ€™s look and feel.

Installation and Usage
Requires Python and Streamlit installed.

Load pre-trained model (model.pkl) and vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl).

Run the app using the command:

text
python -m streamlit run your_app_filename.py
Enter the message/email for classification and click "Detect."

How it Works
The input text is taken from the user.

It is transformed using the saved vectorizer to convert the text into numerical features.

The model then predicts if the message is spam (1) or ham (0).

The result is displayed as either SPAM or HAM.

Benefits
Quick and effective email/message spam detection.

Provides a way to cut through unwanted junk and focus on important content.

Can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into larger systems.
